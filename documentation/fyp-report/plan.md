# Plan

## Introduction
* Dry and empirical or story of framework and how it lays out
* Why JavaScript? Why the Actor Model? What does the artifact enable you to do?
* Significance of the web, actors
* Make a bulleted/number list of the objectives

## Background
* Give background about actors

## Design/Architecture
* Static structure vs how things happen over time. Create timelines on things that relate about time.
* Make a sort of user manual exploring each exposed function of the API
* Cite back to introduction objectives
* Few code segments that are illustrative 

## Benchmarks/Evaluation
* Find sensible way to plot numbers
* Talk about how much code is required to 

## Conclusion
### Similar Work
* What JavaScript frameworks perform like
* Potential 

### Other
* Practical? 
* Address the objectives discussed in the introduction, assess how well the objectives have been reached and what scope there is for the future
* Summary of what has been achieved
