A paper describing the efforts of porting the JVM Akka to JS. 
This project was built on scala-js-actor and is written to mimic JVM Akka code

An article proposing that all physically possible computation can be directly implemented using actors
Talks about how actors should be built. Embracing inconsistency and failure and performing on a best effort basis.

A very useful paper regarding the history of actors. 
It attempts to informally classify attributes that make up an actor system with respect to message processing, reception, state changes and actors per execution environment

Paper comparing Scala Actors to Akka Actors, explaining the reason behind certain design decisions for these languages.
It talks about how programmers interface with actors in the two implementations as well as some challenges which the designs face.
It then talks about the sought after aspects of the actor runtime
